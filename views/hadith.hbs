      <p class="card-text">Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab: I heard Allah's Apostle saying, The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for.</p>

Narrated Ibn 'Umar: Allah's Apostle said: Islam is based on (the following) five (principles): 1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah's Apostle. 2. To offer the (compulsory congregational) prayers dutifully and perfectly. 3. To pay Zakat (i.e. obligatory charity) . 4. To perform Hajj. (i.e. Pilgrimage to Mecca) 5. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan..</p>

      <p class="card-text">(59) Whoever is asked about knowledge while he is busy in some conversation, so he Ô¨Ånished his talk, and then answered the questioner

Narrated Abu Huraira: While the Prophet was saying something in a gathering, a Bedouin came and asked him, When would the Hour (Doomsday) take place? Allah's Apostle continued his talk, so some people said that Allah's Apostle had heard the question, but did not like what that Bedouin had asked. Some of them said that Allah's Apostle had not heard it. When the Prophet finished his speech, he said, Where is the questioner, who inquired about the Hour (Doomsday)? The Bedouin said, I am here, O Allah's Apostle . Then the Prophet said, When honesty is lost, then wait for the Hour (Doomsday). The Bedouin said, How will that be lost? The Prophet said, When the power or authority comes in the hands of unfit persons, then wait for the Hour (Doomsday.)</p>
